## Visualizations

- **Success Rate Chart**: Track success rates over time with intuitive line graphs
- **Time Heat Map**: Identify peak execution times with color-coded hourly distributions
- **Job List View**: Comprehensive metrics for all jobs including:
  - **Total Executions**: Total count of all job runs within the selected time window
  - **Success Rate**: Percentage calculated as (successful executions / total executions) Ã— 100
    - Only considers jobs with at least one execution
    - Jobs with zero executions are excluded from the average
  - **Average Duration**: Mean execution time calculated as (sum of all execution durations / number of executions)
    - Displayed in human-readable format (e.g., "2 minutes", "1 hour")
    - Based on actual run times from start to completion
  - **Failure Count**: Total number of executions with status other than 'succeeded'
    - Includes both failed and aborted executions
    - Used to identify problematic jobs needing attention

## Business Benefits

- Identify problematic jobs with low success rates
- Optimize scheduling by understanding execution patterns
- Make data-driven decisions about job configurations
- Track performance trends over time
- Quickly spot anomalies in job execution patterns

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with:
  - JavaScript enabled
  - localStorage enabled
  - Canvas support for charts
- Project-level access to view job executions

## Configuration

The plugin supports configuration through a UI settings button:
